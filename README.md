We will analyze CO₂ emissions, population, GDP, and endangered species data from UNdata. 
We plan to integrate the datasets using the shared country column. 

Our primary focus is tracking CO₂ emissions over the past 50 years, both globally and in specific countries. We will use line plots to illustrate emissions trends over time and highlight key technological advancements, policy changes, or other significant events that may have driven major changes in emission levels.

In addition, we aim to analyze the relationships between CO₂ emissions and other country-specific factors, such as population and GDP. Specifically, we will examine the correlation between these variables and CO₂ emissions, assessing whether these correlations have increased or decreased over time.

We will also use country data in R to create geographic visualizations to understand spatial trends. Moreover, we would like to display and interact with these correlations in a layered data visualization in which we can see multiple or specified patterns in the same space.

Finally, we want to examine human environmental impact with endangered species data. Again, using R's country data, we can identify the regions with the highest total number of threatened species and the breakdown of vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants. Comparing this information to the CO₂ emission estimates data, we can better understand the relationship between CO₂ emissions and various endangered species.
