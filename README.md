## Plan
We will analyze CO₂ emissions, population, and GDP data. We plan to integrate the datasets using the shared country column. Our data is from the following sources.

https://zenodo.org/records/10065794 

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?end=2023&start=1960&view=chart

https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL

Our primary focus is tracking CO₂ emissions over time, both globally and in specific countries. We will use line plots to illustrate emissions trends over time. Our goal is to utilize R shiny to make these plots interactive, so the user can select specific countries and specific ranges of years. Moreover, we want the user to be able to click a point on the graph and have more details displayed. 

In addition, we aim to analyze the relationships between CO₂ emissions and other country-specific factors, like population and GDP. Specifically, we will examine the correlation between these variables and CO₂ emissions, assessing whether these correlations have increased or decreased over time.

Finally, we will use country data in R to create geographic visualizations to understand the spatial trends of CO₂ emissions. We plan to make several interactive world maps that display things like CO₂ emissions, per capita CO₂ emissions, and annual percent change in CO₂ emissions. Again, we want the user to be able to click on a particular country on the map and have more details displayed. 

## Preliminary Visualizations 
### Plot 1 
The plot displays annual CO2 emissions in metric tonnes from the last 100 years. It focuses on the top three countries with the current highest carbon emissions and the global total. The y-axis ticks are labeled with their units to increase comprehension. In our final project, we plan to create a similar visualization- however, the year range and the countries displayed will be selectable to the viewer.
